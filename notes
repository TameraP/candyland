next time, I'll use vue toggle or collapse to create the effects


getter & setters vs __constructors

if every object has what's declared, then use a constructore

if there are unque characteristics, use getter and setters



Static vs Non-Static

Static methods don't need to instantiated. They're set up like this

$variable = (new ClassName)->get($inputData['specificValue']);
and are called like this
ClassName::method()

static methods use a protected scope

Non-static methods use public scopes and are called like this
$var = new ClassName();
$var->method();

or (new ClassName)->Method();


DB Connection

Both MySQLi and PDO have their advantages:

PDO will work on 12 different database systems, whereas MySQLi will only work with MySQL databases.
(from W3schools- https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_connect.asp)

chose PDO since it works with more db systems

PDO help came from w3schools and https://gist.github.com/jameskropp/eb2b2cc9668a65da0aabc105f8140374
