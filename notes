next time, I'll use vue toggle or collapse to create the effects


getter & setters vs __constructors

if every object has what's declared, then use a constructore

if there are unque characteristics, use getter and setters



Static vs Non-Static

Static methods don't need to instantiated. They're set up like this

$variable = (new ClassName)->get($inputData['specificValue']);
and are called like this
ClassName::method()

static methods use a protected scope

Non-static methods use public scopes and are called like this
$var = new ClassName();
$var->method();

or (new ClassName)->Method();


DB Connection

Both MySQLi and PDO have their advantages:

PDO will work on 12 different database systems, whereas MySQLi will only work with MySQL databases.
(from W3schools- https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_connect.asp)

chose PDO since it works with more db systems

PDO help came from w3schools and https://gist.github.com/jameskropp/eb2b2cc9668a65da0aabc105f8140374 



Fixes & Errors List:

- Onclick Submit: the submit button only clicks once. Why does it do that? What did I do wrong? I've added a second button that shows up after the first is set to hide. But I need to figure out how to trigger a button multiple times? maybe clear the array after?

- new user (not an error, but rather requires more programming): after user create, redirect to login page rather then user profile

- Quesiton: Does it matter if I added validation to the javascript rather than the php class? 
    - I still need to add cleaning and regexp to class to verify that:
        1. The email is an email
        2. The username isn't in use
        3. Injection isn't happening
        4. Limits to how much can be inserted
